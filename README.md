# Playwright Playground

🐳 **Docker-ready** | 🎭 Playwright + TypeScript | API & E2E Testing

A TypeScript-based Playwright test automation framework showcasing both API and End-to-End (E2E) testing practices.

Fully containerized with Docker for consistent, environment-agnostic test execution.

**Website Under Test:** [Conduit (Learn WebdriverIO)](https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com/)

## 📊 Live Test Report - GitHub Pages:

Every push triggers the full suite via GitHub Actions, and the HTML report is automatically published to GitHub Pages — no need to clone the repo or dig through CI logs to see the results:

**🔗 [View the latest test report](https://oleskicode.github.io/Playwright-Typescript-with-GitHubActions-conduit-oleski/)**

The report includes full traces, screenshots, and step-by-step breakdowns for every run, across all browser/device projects (`chromium`, `android`, `iphone`) — always reflecting the most recent commit on `master`.

## Technologies Used

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - A Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerized test execution with all browser engines pre-installed, no local setup required.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have an active, registered user account on the website.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Install Playwright Browsers:**

```bash
npx playwright install
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project and populate it with your registered user credentials:

```env
USER_NAME=someJohn
USER_EMAIL=john@testemail.com
USER_PASSWORD=sdfgsADSG123
API_BASE_URL=https://conduit-api.learnwebdriverio.com/api
BASE_URL=https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com
```

4. **Run the tests:**

```bash
npx playwright test
```

5. **View the test report:**

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

---

## Running with Docker

The test suite is fully containerized using the official Playwright image, which bundles all three browser engines (Chromium, WebKit, and Mobile Chrome) so no local browser installation is required.

1. **Build the image:**

```bash
docker compose build
```

2. **Run the full suite:**

```bash
docker compose run --rm tests
```

This spins up a container that runs `globalSetup` (registering the test user via the API, fetching an auth token, and seeding `localStorage`), then executes all 57 tests across the `chromium`, `android`, and `iphone` projects.

3. **View results:**

Test artifacts are written to the host via volume mounts, so they're available after the container exits:

```bash
npx playwright show-report   # opens ./playwright-report
ls test-results/             # screenshots, traces for failed tests
```

### Rebuilding after code changes

The image is built once from a snapshot of the project (`COPY . .` in the `Dockerfile`). **Editing test files locally does not change an already-built image** — rebuild to pick up changes:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm tests
```

### Notes from building this out

- **Worker count**: `playwright.config.ts` sets `workers: 1` when `CI=true` (set in `docker-compose.yml`) for deterministic runs. Local runs can override this for speed, e.g. `docker compose run --rm tests npx playwright test --workers=4`. Since tests hit a shared external demo API, higher worker counts increase load on a backend outside our control — 4 workers roughly halved run time without issues in testing, but this is worth tuning rather than assuming.
- **Test data isolation**: an earlier version of `helpers/userFactory.ts` generated usernames via `faker.person.firstName()`, which draws from a small fixed pool. Under parallel execution against a long-lived shared backend, this occasionally collided with already-registered usernames (`"username": "is already taken."`). Fixed by appending a timestamp + random suffix to guarantee uniqueness per test run.

## Project Structure

- `tests/` - Contains all API and E2E test files.
  - `api-tests/` - API specific tests.
  - `ui-tests/` - User interface specific tests.
- `pages/` - Page Object Model implementations for UI tests.
- `fixtures/` - Custom Playwright fixtures for authenticated API contexts and page objects.
- `helpers/` - Helper functions and utilities for common tasks.
- `setup/` - Setup files for global test configurations, like user registration.
- `playwright.config.ts` - Global Playwright configuration, timeouts, and browser matrices.
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables (tracked in git).
- `Dockerfile` - Defines the containerized test runner image.
- `docker-compose.yml` - Orchestrates running the suite in a container.
- `.dockerignore` - Excludes files (like `node_modules`, `.env`) from the build context.
